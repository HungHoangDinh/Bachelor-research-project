It is a common symptom associated with several serious health conditions. In the context of bronchiectasis, khó thở often results from respiratory distress due to lung damage. Additionally, it serves as a key indicator of respiratory failure, highlighting the challenges in breathing. This symptom is also prevalent in conditions such as emphysema, where the lungs are unable to provide sufficient oxygen to the body, and pneumonia, which indicates a decline in respiratory function, particularly in children. Furthermore, khó thở can manifest as a severe symptom in cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in more critical situations. Overall, khó thở is a significant clinical sign that may suggest underlying cardiac or pulmonary diseases.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1747328996, "model": "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_71b02749fa", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 329, "total_tokens": 497, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
