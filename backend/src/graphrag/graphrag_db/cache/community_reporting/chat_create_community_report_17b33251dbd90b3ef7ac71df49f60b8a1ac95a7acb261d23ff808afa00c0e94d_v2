It is a common symptom associated with several serious health conditions. In the context of bronchiectasis, khó thở often results from respiratory distress due to lung damage. Additionally, it serves as a key indicator of respiratory failure, highlighting the challenges in breathing. This symptom is also prevalent in conditions such as emphysema, where the lungs are unable to provide sufficient oxygen to the body, and pneumonia, which indicates a decline in respiratory function, particularly in children. Furthermore, khó thở can manifest as a severe symptom in cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in more critical situations.
